# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Terrorism
Data Science
Project Overview
This project involves conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to terrorism. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can inform further analysis or decision-making related to terrorism activities.

# Features
Data Exploration: Investigating the dataset to understand its structure, contents, and quality.
Trend Analysis: Identifying and analyzing trends over time in terrorism incidents.
Geospatial Analysis: Mapping terrorism incidents to uncover geographical patterns.
Categorical Analysis: Analyzing the distribution of terrorism incidents across different categories such as attack types, regions, and organizations.
Workflow
# Data Collection

Dataset: Obtain and load the terrorism dataset, which may include details such as incident dates, locations, attack types, and casualty figures.
# Data Cleaning

Missing Values: Identify and handle missing or incomplete data.
Data Types: Ensure data types are correct and convert if necessary (e.g., dates to datetime objects).
Outliers: Detect and address outliers that could skew the analysis.
Descriptive Statistics

# Summary Statistics:
Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical features.
Distribution Analysis: Examine the distribution of variables like attack frequency, casualties, and regions.
Trend Analysis

Temporal Trends: Analyze trends over time, including changes in the frequency of incidents and patterns in attack types.
Seasonality: Investigate any seasonal effects or periodic patterns in terrorism activities.
# Geospatial Analysis

Mapping: Create maps to visualize the geographic distribution of terrorism incidents.
Regional Analysis: Assess terrorism activity by region or country to identify hotspots.
# Categorical Analysis

Attack Types: Explore the distribution and frequency of different types of attacks.
Organizations: Analyze the involvement of various organizations in terrorism activities.
Targets: Examine the types of targets (e.g., civilian, military) and their distribution.
# Visualization

Charts and Graphs: Use visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps to present findings clearly and effectively.
Interactive Tools: Implement interactive visualizations to allow for more in-depth exploration of the data.
Results and Insights
Key Findings: Summarize the main discoveries from the EDA, including any significant trends, patterns, or anomalies.
Recommendations: Provide recommendations for further analysis or actions based on the insights gained.
